MacOSX-Like Metacity theme
##########################

It works with gnome-3. I just took an existent theme and:


* Changed colors (I love dark titlebars)
* Removed window borders (we have a drop shadow, we don't need borders..)
* Replaced "menu" icon with application icon (application icons are nice)


Installation
============

Just place this in your ``~/.theme`` folder and enable it from theme settings.
